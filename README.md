This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, follow these steps:

1. **Set the Ruby Version**

   Make sure you have `chruby` installed. You can switch to the required Ruby version by running:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bash_profile
   chruby ruby-3.3.5
   ```

2. **Start the Rails Server**

   Once the Ruby version is set, you can start the Rails server by executing:

   ```bash
   bin/rails server -p 3001
   ```

   This will start the server on port 3001. You can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3001` in your web browser.
